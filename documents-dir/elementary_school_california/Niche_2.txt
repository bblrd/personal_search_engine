4 Best Public Elementary Schools in California
Parent: I have a 3rd grader at this school. The teachers are caring, well-prepared, and dedicated. The students are eager to learn. The parents are friendly and involved. The staff is dedicated and helpful. The students learn a lot, with, it seems to me, particular focus on reading and writing, particularly on reading comprehension and writing structure. There is also a lot of focus on being good citizens being caring towards others, and anti-bullying messages. There is a lot of art and other extras, as well as a lot of after-school activities. I feel like my daughter is getting a well-rounded school experience. She is above grade in her work, and there is a group of similar kids which the teacher works hard to keep engaged and learning. I have been very happy with every grade of her education at Palo Verde.

Point Vicente Elementary School
Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, CAK-5

20 Best Public Elementary Schools in California
Niche User: Going to Point Vicnete was very well. I started in 1st grade and had the amazing principal Becky Cash. Although she unfortunately left in 3rd grade, our new principal Beth Hadley wasn't all bad. Although she will never be as good as Ms Cash. 4th grade will most likely be the worst year because Mrs Soto is very rude. I do not know about Mrs Wang because she recently got the job. 1st 2nd and 3rd grade was AMAZING with some of the best teachers I have seen (I'm a sophomore at Peninsula) 5th grade was okay, as Outdoor Science School was amazing. Hope I helped make up your mind on a elementary school :)
