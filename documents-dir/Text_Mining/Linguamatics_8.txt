What is text mining?


Let's say you have a huge number of documents and data, and you're looking for something important that you think lies hidden within.

How do you go about searching those documents?



Traditional keyword search retrieves all the documents that contain the keywords you’ve specified.

That’s great as far as it goes, but you still have to read all those documents to find out whether they actually contain any information that’s relevant to your search.



Text mining software is very different, because it reads and analyzes the documents on your behalf.

It can understand real meanings thanks to sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms, which allow it to recognize similar concepts – even if they’ve been expressed in very different ways, or with different spellings.

A search using text mining will identify facts, relationships and assertions that would otherwise remain buried in a mass of ‘big data’.
